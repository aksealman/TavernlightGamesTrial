The impl_questions folder contains the answer to questions 1-4.

The tfs_otc_questions folder contains my answers to questions 5-7.

The top level folder is the question name. Each lower level folder corralates to a location within the specific appplication.

For example question 5 was developed on top of theforgottenserver so the folder structure looks like.

/question5/forgottenserver/data/spells/scripts/attacks/question5.lua

This file would be stored in the /data/spells/scripts/attacks folder of your own forgottenserver instance. Questions 6 and 7 work the same way except with the otc client.

The tfs_otc_questions/videos folder contains the recordings of questions 5-6.

The tfs_otc_questions/forgottenserver and tfs_otc_questions/otclient folders are the codebases that I worked off of.
